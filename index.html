            <h1>Bomb Defuser</h1>
            <p>You need to work together with a friend to make sure you see your kids again! Be careful, three strikes and you get turned in to spaghetti sauce. Click play to be the defuser, and press all the wrong buttons on accident. Click manual to be the manual reader, who constantly asks the defuser to redescribe what they see, while the timer ticks down faster, and faster.</p>
            <p>Best played in fullscreen</p>
